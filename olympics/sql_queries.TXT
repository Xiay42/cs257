List all the NOCs (National Olympic Committees), in alphabetical order by abbreviation. These entities, by the way, are mostly equivalent to countries. But in some cases, you might find that a portion of a country participated in a particular games (e.g. one guy from Newfoundland in 1904) or some other oddball situation:
SELECT nocstable.noc
FROM nocstable
ORDER BY nocstable.noc;


List the names of all the athletes from Jamaica. If your database design allows it, sort the athletes by last name:
SELECT DISTINCT athletestable.name
FROM athletestable, linkstable, nocstable
WHERE athletestable.id = linkstable.athleteID
AND nocstable.id = linkstable.nocID
AND nocstable.region = 'Jamaica';


List all the medals won by Greg Louganis, sorted by year. Include whatever fields in this output that you think appropriate:
SELECT athletestable.name, eventstable.event_name, linkstable.medal
FROM eventstable, linkstable, athletestable
WHERE eventstable.id = linkstable.eventID
AND linkstable.athleteID = athletestable.id
AND athletestable.name = 'Gregory Efthimios "Greg" Louganis'
AND NOT linkstable.medal = 'NA';


List all the NOCs and the number of gold medals they have won, in decreasing order of the number of gold medalsï¼š
SELECT gmtable.nocID, nocstable.region, gmtable.gm
FROM gmtable, nocstable
WHERE nocstable.id = gmtable.nocID
ORDER BY gmtable.gm DESC;
